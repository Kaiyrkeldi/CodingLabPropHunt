# CodingLabPropHunt
Project description:
The theme of the project is Prop Hunt game created using Unity and C# technologies. Prop Hunt is a game about taking a shape of an object from the given world and hiding somewhere on a map. There are two types of characters in a game – props and hunters. Props hide and hunters should find props and fire on them. There is a time limit within which hunters look for a hidden people. If time runs out and all props were not found, they won, otherwise hunters win. If prop dies, user can still observe the game as a ghost. 
When user runs game, it opens a menu of a game with three available options – play game, options, and exit. By choosing ‘Play game’ the game starts and user is free to choose character. When all users are ready, props have some time to hide and game starts.

Scenarios:
The Props are disguised as objects around the map. Props win if the time runs out or all hunters die. If you Prop: you should hide from hunter. To do this, take the form of item when game starts. Then try to merge with other things and stay alive until time ends. if you get caught you have a chance to escape from the hunter by running.

The Hunters have one mission: hunt down Props and eliminate them one by one until only the inanimate objects remain. The first thing to remember is that you have a limited amount of time, so shooting anything in sight might not be the best strategy. Instead, take a more targeted approach and fire at items that seem to have no business being in their current position, but keep in mind that any shot not at a prop costs you health points.
